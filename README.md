Quake 3 Tools
=============

This is a vew very simple tools that I wrote so that get various tools
I had in my personal development environment to work together relating
to producing content for the Quake 3 game engine.  Principally, I used
the Quake 3 game engine as a component of the computer game _Star Wars
Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy_.

What was my development environment and tools?

* Windows XP
* LucasArts modified Quake 3 game engine for JKJA
* QuArK, "Quake Swiss Army Knife" Quake map and asset editor
* GtkRadiant, another Quake map editor
* Misfit Model 3D, a very simple 3D modeling software that worked well
  on my low-end PC
